------INTRO + TECHNOLOGIES USED------

ASK-BILL is an app that helps people figure out an activity to do based on 9 different types of activities. It is written entirely with html, css, javascript and jQuery. I used ajax to pull from the boredAPI.

------APPROACH-------

My approach started when I came across the boredAPI and came up with a good idea to give people ideas for activities to do. Quarantine has caused people to get the feeling of being in the movie, Groundhog's Day. So I played off that theme by having Bill Murray help you decide what activity to do. I used a loop to create 9 different buttons with the 9 different "types" of activities that the api provides. Bill Murray is seen throughout the movie reading a newspaper. So I went off that them to showcase the activity selected. A modal pops up on the screen that looks like a classified ad with info about the activity in the format of a classified ad.

------UNSOLVED PROBLEMS------
Making the site responsive to mobile/tablet. I struggled heavily with this. I should have this in mind while I styled it from the beginning.
